If no test tools detected, search for current best practices:
  Query: "best <platform> testing tools 2025"

Replace <platform> with detected project type (Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, etc.)

Example:
  fspec configure-tools --test-command "npm test"

  2. Add business rules (blue cards):
     fspec add-rule AUTH-001 "Rule text"

  3. Add concrete examples (green cards):
     fspec add-example AUTH-001 "Example text"

  4. Ask questions (red cards):
     fspec add-question AUTH-001 "@human: Question text?"

  5. Generate scenarios from example map:
     fspec generate-scenarios AUTH-001

  Stories use Example Mapping to define acceptance criteria through conversation.

  1. Set user story fields:
     fspec set-user-story AUTH-001 --role "role" --action "action" --benefit "benefit"

  2. Add business rules (blue cards):
     fspec add-rule AUTH-001 "Rule text"

  3. Add concrete examples (green cards):
     fspec add-example AUTH-001 "Example text"

  4. Ask questions (red cards):
     fspec add-question AUTH-001 "@human: Question text?"

  5. Generate scenarios from example map:
     fspec generate-scenarios AUTH-001

Example Mapping helps clarify requirements before writing code.

REMOVE-TAG-FROM-SCENARIO
Remove one or more tags from a specific scenario in a feature file

WHEN TO USE
  Use this command when you need to remove tags from a specific scenario, such as removing @wip after completing work, removing @deprecated before deletion, or cleaning up incorrect tags.

USAGE
  fspec remove-tag-from-scenario <file> <scenario> <tags...>

ARGUMENTS
  <file> (required)
    Feature file path (e.g., spec/features/login.feature)
  <scenario> (required)
    Scenario name exactly as it appears in the feature file (e.g., "Login with valid credentials")
  <tags...> (required)
    One or more tags to remove (e.g., @wip @deprecated) - must include @ symbol

OPTIONS
  No options available

EXAMPLES
  1. Remove single tag from scenario
  $ fspec remove-tag-from-scenario spec/features/login.feature "Login with valid credentials" @wip
  ✓ Removed tag @wip from scenario "Login with valid credentials"

  2. Remove multiple tags from scenario
  $ fspec remove-tag-from-scenario spec/features/login.feature "Login with valid credentials" @wip @manual
  ✓ Removed tags @wip, @manual from scenario "Login with valid credentials"

COMMON ERRORS
  ✗ Scenario not found
    Fix: Ensure scenario name matches exactly (case-sensitive)

  ✗ Tag not found on scenario
    Fix: Use list-scenario-tags to see current tags on the scenario

RELATED COMMANDS
  fspec add-tag-to-scenario
  fspec list-scenario-tags
  fspec remove-tag-from-feature
  fspec retag

NOTES
  • Scenario names are case-sensitive and must match exactly
  • Tags must include the @ symbol
  • Removing a tag that does not exist on the scenario will show an error
  • Feature file is automatically reformatted after tag removal

No test command configured. Use Read/Glob tools to detect test framework, then run:

  fspec configure-tools --test-command <cmd>

If no test tools detected, search for current best practices:
  Query: "best <platform> testing tools 2025"

Replace <platform> with detected project type (Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, etc.)

Example:
  fspec configure-tools --test-command "npm test"
  fspec configure-tools --test-command "pytest"
  fspec configure-tools --test-command "cargo test"

[22m[39m**IMPORTANT:** NO TEST COMMAND CONFIGURED

No test command configured. Use Read/Glob tools to detect test framework, then run:

  fspec configure-tools --test-command <cmd>

If no test tools detected, search for current best practices:
  Query: "best <platform> testing tools 2025"

Replace <platform> with detected project type (Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, etc.)

Example:
  fspec configure-tools --test-command "npm test"
  fspec configure-tools --test-command "pytest"
  fspec configure-tools --test-command "cargo test"

Choose how to proceed:
  1. Commit changes first [Low risk]
     Safest option. Commits current changes before restoration.
  2. Stash changes and restore [Medium risk]
     Temporarily saves changes. Can restore later if needed.
  3. Overwrite files (discard changes) [High risk]
     Overwrites working directory with checkpoint. Current changes will be LOST FOREVER unless committed or stashed.

[22m[39m⚠️  Working directory has uncommitted changes

Choose how to proceed:
  1. Commit changes first [Low risk]
     Safest option. Commits current changes before restoration.
  2. Stash changes and restore [Medium risk]
     Temporarily saves changes. Can restore later if needed.
  3. Overwrite files (discard changes) [High risk]
     Overwrites working directory with checkpoint. Current changes will be LOST FOREVER unless committed or stashed.

No test command configured. Use Read/Glob tools to detect test framework, then run:

If no test tools detected, search for current best practices:
  Query: "best <platform> testing tools 2025"

Replace <platform> with detected project type (Node.js, Python, Rust, Go, etc.)

Example:
  fspec configure-tools --test-command "npm test"

  fspec configure-tools --test-command "cargo test"
