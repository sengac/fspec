Unicode Terminal Width Test - Emoji Presentation Issue
=======================================================

Root Cause:
- Characters like ☁, ❤, ✨ have Emoji_Presentation=No in Unicode (they're text by default)
- Adding U+FE0F (variation selector) requests emoji presentation
- string-width correctly reports width 2 for these when VS16 is present
- BUT many terminals ignore U+FE0F and render as width 1

The Discrepancy:
- ☁️ (with U+FE0F): string-width=20, terminal=19  OFF BY 1
- ❤️ (with U+FE0F): string-width=20, terminal=19  OFF BY 1

Test Characters:
================

Text presentation (no variation selector):
☁ ❤ ✨ ⭐ ☀ ❌ ✅ ⚠ ⚡ 🔥

Emoji presentation (with U+FE0F variation selector):
☁️ ❤️ ✨ ⭐️ ☀️ ❌ ✅ ⚠️ ⚡️ 🔥

Mixed line test:
Weather: ☁️ Sunny: ☀️ Storm: ⚡️ Fire: 🔥 Status: ✅

Terminal width calculation test:
This line has ☁️ (cloud with VS16)
This line has ❤️ (heart with VS16)
This line has ✨ (sparkles with VS16)
This line has ⭐️ (star with VS16)
This line has ☀️ (sun with VS16)

Expected string-width: 2 per emoji with VS16
Expected terminal width: 1 per emoji with VS16 (in many terminals)

Note: The discrepancy occurs because terminals may not support the variation
selector U+FE0F properly, causing them to render the text version (width 1)
while string-width libraries correctly report the requested emoji width (width 2).
