## Vision

Transform AI agents into professional software builders by providing complete infrastructure for spec-driven development—from collaborative discovery (Example Mapping, Event Storming) through disciplined ACDD workflow (Kanban, work units, dependencies), safety nets (checkpoints, validation, quality gates), and full traceability (scenarios → tests → code), enabling teams to ship production-ready systems with living documentation and end-to-end accountability.

## Problem Space

### AI agents lack professional software development infrastructure and discipline

AI agents operate without the foundational tools and processes that professional developers rely on. While it's possible to manually enforce acceptance criteria or capture requirements through collaborative discovery, there's nothing easy or automated to help AI agents do it correctly. AI agents confabulate without quality examples and don't ask clarifying questions when faced with uncertainty. TDD guardrails aren't automated. Checkpoint systems for safe experimentation are either missing or poorly implemented. Kanban boards for tracking workflow state require manual effort. Specification management systems with diagram viewers and documentation aren't integrated into AI workflows. Coverage tracking to link code back to business rules isn't automated. Without easy, automated infrastructure, AI agents code blindly, making teams spend time babysitting rather than building, unable to trust AI for production-grade development.

**Impact:** high

## Solution Space

### Overview

Provide a complete, automated infrastructure that integrates directly into AI agent workflows. Offer easy-to-use tools for collaborative discovery (Example Mapping, Event Storming) that guide AI agents through proper requirements gathering. Automate ACDD workflow management with Kanban boards, work units, and dependency tracking. Build in automatic checkpoints for safe experimentation and instant rollback. Enforce TDD discipline with automated validation gates that prevent code-before-tests. Provide integrated specification management with visual diagram support. Automatically track full traceability from business rules through scenarios to tests to implementation. Transform the AI development experience from manual babysitting to automated, disciplined, production-ready software delivery.

### Capabilities

- **Collaborative Discovery**: Guide teams through Example Mapping and Event Storming sessions to capture requirements, business rules, and domain events before writing code
- **ACDD Workflow Management**: Track work units through Kanban states (backlog → specifying → testing → implementing → validating → done) with automatic checkpoints and quality gates
- **Specification Management**: Create, validate, and manage Gherkin feature files with scenarios, tags, and automatic syntax checking
- **Coverage Tracking**: Link Gherkin scenarios to test implementations to production code with automatic traceability and gap detection
- **Safety Nets**: Automatic Git checkpoints before state transitions with instant rollback capability for safe experimentation
- **Analytics & Metrics**: Track velocity, estimate accuracy, bottlenecks, and quality metrics across the development lifecycle
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time TUI with Kanban board, attachment viewer (markdown + mermaid diagrams), and checkpoint management
