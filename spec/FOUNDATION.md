## Vision

An AI discipline system that transforms AI agents into professional software engineers through workflow enforcement, temporal validation, traceability linking, and intelligent anti-drift patterns - ensuring every line of code traces back to tested acceptance criteria and business rules.

---

## Problem Space

### AI Agents Lack Professional Development Discipline

AI coding agents operate without the structured workflow discipline that professional developers rely on. They skip critical discovery steps like Example Mapping, write code before tests, ignore acceptance criteria, work out of temporal order, and lack traceability from code back to business requirements. This forces developers into constant supervision mode - micromanaging the AI, catching mistakes, and manually enforcing workflow steps - instead of focusing on higher-level problem solving and architecture.

**Impact:** high

## Solution Space

### Overview

fspec provides a complete workflow enforcement system that guides AI agents through professional ACDD (Acceptance Criteria Driven Development) practices. It enforces temporal ordering to prevent retroactive workflow walking, uses system reminders to catch anti-patterns, maintains end-to-end traceability from code to business rules, provides git-based checkpoints for safe experimentation, and integrates research tools for discovery-first development. The system transforms AI agents from undisciplined code generators into structured software engineers.

### Capabilities

- **ACDD Workflow Management**: Manage work units through structured Kanban workflow states (backlog → specifying → testing → implementing → validating → done) with temporal validation preventing retroactive workflow walking
- **Example Mapping Discovery**: Capture business rules, concrete examples, questions, and assumptions using Example Mapping technique before writing specifications
- **Event Storming Discovery**: Document domain events, commands, policies, aggregates, and hotspots for complex domains before Example Mapping
- **Gherkin Specification Management**: Create, validate, format, and manage Gherkin feature files with automatic syntax validation and tag compliance
- **Test-Feature Coverage Tracking**: Link test files to Gherkin scenarios and implementation code with step validation ensuring traceability from business rules to code
- **Git Checkpoint System**: Create automatic and manual checkpoints using git stash for safe experimentation with conflict-aware restoration
- **System Reminder Anti-Drift**: Detect anti-patterns and guide AI agents with contextual system-reminder tags for file naming, workflow violations, and missing steps
- **Virtual Hooks Quality Gates**: Attach ephemeral work unit-scoped hooks for linting, testing, and validation with git context support
- **Dependency Management**: Track work unit dependencies, identify bottlenecks, detect circular dependencies, and visualize critical paths
- **Interactive Kanban TUI**: View and manage work units through terminal UI with attachment viewer, checkpoint management, and real-time updates

## Personas

### AI Coding Agent

Autonomous AI assistants (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor) that execute development tasks through natural language instructions and must follow structured ACDD workflow

**Goals:**
- Execute workflow steps in correct order without skipping discovery, testing, or validation phases

### Developer Using AI Agents

Software engineers who delegate coding tasks to AI agents and need to ensure quality output without constant supervision

**Goals:**
- Ship tested, traceable code faster by trusting AI to follow professional workflows
- Avoid babysitting AI agents and focus on architecture and problem-solving

### Solo Developer

Individual developers working without AI who want structured BDD/TDD workflow discipline for personal projects

**Goals:**
- Maintain professional development practices on solo projects
- Ensure all code has tested acceptance criteria and business rule traceability

### Quality Assurance Engineer

QA engineers who need to verify that implemented features match acceptance criteria and maintain test coverage

**Goals:**
- Validate that all scenarios have corresponding tests with full traceability
- Audit coverage to ensure business rules are properly tested

### Business Analyst

Business analysts who document requirements using Example Mapping and need to ensure features are built according to business rules

**Goals:**
- Capture business rules and examples using structured discovery techniques
- Track which work units implement which business capabilities

### Product Owner

Product owners who prioritize work, manage backlogs, and need visibility into development progress and feature completion

**Goals:**
- Prioritize work units based on business value and dependencies
- Track team velocity and estimate accuracy across iterations
- Ensure delivered features match original business intent

### Technical Lead

Technical leads and architects who review code quality, ensure architectural standards, and validate technical decisions

**Goals:**
- Review implementation coverage and ensure code traces back to acceptance criteria
- Identify architectural debt and refactoring opportunities
- Validate that technical standards are followed across all work units
