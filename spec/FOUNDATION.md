# fspec Project Foundation

## Vision

A Spec-Driven Development tool for AI Agents to manage Gherkin specifications and work units with enforced ACDD workflow

---

## Problem Space

### Primary Problem

AI coding agents excel at writing code but struggle to build quality software reliably. Without structure, they lose context between sessions, skip discovery, violate ACDD workflow (writing code before tests/specs), build the wrong thing, and create specification chaos with malformed Gherkin and inconsistent tags. Flat TODO lists show done/not done but lack workflow state, dependencies, or relationships.

**Impact:** high

---

## Solution Space

### Overview

fspec provides persistent queryable state with enforced Kanban workflow and collaborative discovery: Kanban workflow enforces ACDD phases (backlog → specifying → testing → implementing → validating → done), work units provide persistent project state with dependencies and epic relationships, Example Mapping enables structured discovery through questions and answers, queryable state allows AI to check current status without relying on conversation context, validated Gherkin using official Cucumber parser, JSON-backed tag registry prevents tag chaos, coverage tracking links scenarios to test files and implementation code, and visual board displays work across all Kanban states.
