## Bug #1: Field Name Mismatch - `nextNoteId` vs `nextArchitectureNoteId`

### Severity: CRITICAL
**Will cause:** ID collision bugs, data corruption

### Problem Description

The architecture note ID counter field has inconsistent naming across the codebase:

- **Type definition** (`src/types/index.ts:77`): `nextNoteId?: number;`
- **Migration** (`src/migrations/migrations/001-stable-indices.ts:85-87`): Uses `nextNoteId` ✅
- **add-architecture-note.ts** (`src/commands/add-architecture-note.ts:36-42`): Uses `nextNoteId` ✅
- **compact-work-unit.ts** (`src/commands/compact-work-unit.ts:136`): Uses `nextArchitectureNoteId` ❌
- **Help documentation** (`src/utils/slashCommandSections/kanbanWorkflow.ts:116`): Documents `nextArchitectureNoteId` ❌

### Impact

**After compaction, the ID counter will be set on the wrong field:**

```typescript
// What currently happens (BUGGY):
workUnit.nextArchitectureNoteId = workUnit.architectureNotes.length; // Line 136

// What exists in memory:
{
  nextNoteId: 0,  // Still at default from migration
  nextArchitectureNoteId: 3  // Set by compaction (WRONG FIELD)
}

// Next time someone adds architecture note:
const newNote = {
  id: workUnit.nextNoteId++,  // Uses nextNoteId which is still 0!
  text: "New note",
  deleted: false,
  createdAt: now
};

// Result: ID collision! New note gets id=0 which conflicts with existing note at index 0
```

### Reproduction Steps

1. Create work unit with 5 architecture notes
2. Delete notes at indices 1 and 3
3. Run `fspec compact-work-unit AUTH-001`
4. Compaction sets `nextArchitectureNoteId = 3` (wrong field)
5. Run `fspec add-architecture-note AUTH-001 "New note"`
6. New note gets `id = 0` from `nextNoteId` (which was never updated)
7. **BUG:** ID collision with existing note at index 0

### Files Affected

1. `src/commands/compact-work-unit.ts:136`
2. `src/utils/slashCommandSections/kanbanWorkflow.ts:116`

### Fix Required

```diff
// File: src/commands/compact-work-unit.ts
Line 136:
-   workUnit.nextArchitectureNoteId = workUnit.architectureNotes.length;
+   workUnit.nextNoteId = workUnit.architectureNotes.length;
```

```diff
// File: src/utils/slashCommandSections/kanbanWorkflow.ts
Line 116:
- - Auto-increment from 0 (nextRuleId, nextExampleId, nextQuestionId, nextArchitectureNoteId)
+ - Auto-increment from 0 (nextRuleId, nextExampleId, nextQuestionId, nextNoteId)
```

### Test Coverage Gap

**Current tests DO NOT catch this bug** because:
- Tests don't verify the full workflow: compact → add new item
- Tests check compaction logic but not subsequent ID generation
- No test for "add architecture note after compaction"

**Required test:**
```typescript
it('should use correct ID counter after compaction', async () => {
  // Setup: work unit with notes
  // Delete some notes
  // Compact
  // Add new note
  // Verify: new note ID does NOT collide with existing IDs
});
```

## Bug #2: State Sorting Lost During Auto-Compact

### Severity: CRITICAL
**Will cause:** Data loss, user-defined sort orders discarded

### Problem Description

When moving a work unit to 'done' status with custom sorting, the state sorting changes are lost:

**Location:** `src/commands/update-work-unit-status.ts:450-467`

```typescript
// Line 450: States are sorted and updated
workUnitsData.states = updatedWorkUnitsData.states;

// Line 454-458: compactWorkUnit() SAVES to disk
await compactWorkUnit({
  workUnitId: options.workUnitId,
  force: true,
  cwd,
});

// Line 461: Re-reading from disk LOSES the state sorting!
workUnitsData = await ensureWorkUnitsFile(cwd);
workUnit = workUnitsData.workUnits[options.workUnitId];
```

### Impact

**User-defined sort orders are permanently lost:**

1. User moves work unit from `validating` to `done`
2. System sorts `done` state array (e.g., by completion time)
3. Sorted state changes stored in memory: `workUnitsData.states.done = [...sorted]`
4. Auto-compact triggers: `compactWorkUnit()` saves work unit data to disk
5. **BUG:** `compactWorkUnit()` doesn't know about the sorted states, saves WITHOUT them
6. System re-reads from disk: `workUnitsData = await ensureWorkUnitsFile(cwd)`
7. **Result:** Sorted state changes are gone

### Reproduction Steps

1. Create work units BOARD-001, BOARD-002, BOARD-003
2. Move them to `done` in specific order
3. System applies sort order (e.g., most recent first)
4. Check work-units.json: states.done = [BOARD-003, BOARD-002, BOARD-001]
5. Create BOARD-004, add soft-deleted items
6. Move BOARD-004 to `done` (triggers auto-compact)
7. Check work-units.json: **Sort order lost**, states.done order changed

### Files Affected

1. `src/commands/update-work-unit-status.ts:450-467`
2. `src/commands/compact-work-unit.ts` (needs to accept sorted states)

### Fix Required

**Option A: Apply sorting AFTER compaction**

```diff
// File: src/commands/update-work-unit-status.ts
Line 450-467:

- // Sort states BEFORE compaction
- workUnitsData.states = updatedWorkUnitsData.states;

  // Auto-compact when moving to done status
  if (newStatus === 'done') {
    await compactWorkUnit({
      workUnitId: options.workUnitId,
      force: true,
      cwd,
    });

    // Re-read work units data after compaction
    workUnitsData = await ensureWorkUnitsFile(cwd);
    workUnit = workUnitsData.workUnits[options.workUnitId];
  }

+ // Sort states AFTER compaction (so changes aren't lost)
+ workUnitsData.states = updatedWorkUnitsData.states;
```

**Option B: Pass sorted states to compactWorkUnit**

Modify `compactWorkUnit()` to accept and preserve sorted states during save.

### Test Coverage Gap

**Current tests DO NOT catch this bug** because:
- Tests verify auto-compact removes deleted items
- Tests don't verify state sorting preservation
- No integration test for: sort states → auto-compact → verify sort preserved

**Required test:**
```typescript
it('should preserve state sorting during auto-compact', async () => {
  // Setup: work units in specific order
  // Move to done with sort order applied
  // Verify: sort order matches expected after auto-compact
});
```

## Additional Issues (Medium/Low Severity)

### 3. Ambiguous Output in `show-deleted` Command

**Severity:** HIGH - Confusing UX

The command shows deleted items without indicating which collection (rule/example/question/note):

```bash
Deleted items in AUTH-001 (4 total):
  [2] Old business rule        # Is this a rule or example?
  [2] Obsolete example          # Same ID as above!
  [3] Removed question
  [3] Deleted note              # Same ID as question!
```

**Fix:** Add collection type prefix:
```
  [rule:2] Old business rule
  [example:2] Obsolete example
  [question:3] Removed question
  [note:3] Deleted note
```

### 4. Overly Restrictive Restore Status Check

**Severity:** HIGH - Limits functionality

All restore commands only allow restoration during `specifying` state:

```typescript
if (workUnit.status !== 'specifying') {
  throw new Error(`Can only restore rules during discovery/specification phase...`);
}
```

**Problem:** If someone accidentally deletes an item during `testing` or `implementing`, they CANNOT restore it without:
1. Moving back to `specifying`
2. Restoring the item
3. Moving forward again

**Recommendation:** Allow restore during any non-`done` status (done triggers auto-compact anyway).

### 5. Widespread `any` Type Usage in Implementation

**Severity:** MEDIUM - Violates standards

While tests are now type-safe, implementation files still have `any` violations:

- `src/migrations/migrations/001-stable-indices.ts`: 11 occurrences
- All `catch (error: any)` throughout codebase

**Note:** This is codebase-wide, not specific to stable indices.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes Required (Before Production):

1. **Fix `nextNoteId` field name** in compact-work-unit.ts:136 ✅ CRITICAL
2. **Fix state sorting loss** in update-work-unit-status.ts:450-467 ✅ CRITICAL
3. **Add test coverage** for both bugs ✅ CRITICAL

### Should Fix (Quality improvements):

4. **Fix `show-deleted` output** to include collection type
5. **Remove or relax restore status restriction**
6. **Fix `any` types in migration file**

---

## Testing Strategy

### New Tests Required:

1. **Test: ID counter after compaction**
   - Verify `nextNoteId` is correctly set after compact
   - Verify new architecture notes don't have ID collisions
   - Verify workflow: compact → add item → check ID

2. **Test: State sorting preservation**
   - Verify state sorting survives auto-compact
   - Verify sort order matches expected after status change
   - Verify integration: sort → auto-compact → re-read → verify

3. **Test: Field name consistency**
   - Verify all operations use `nextNoteId` (not `nextArchitectureNoteId`)
   - Verify migration, add, compact, restore all use same field

### Regression Testing:

All existing tests (16/16) must continue to pass after fixes.

---

## Timeline

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours
- Bug #1 fix: 15 minutes (2 lines changed)
- Bug #2 fix: 30 minutes (refactor auto-compact flow)
- Test coverage: 90 minutes (write 3 integration tests)
- Verification: 30 minutes (run full test suite, manual testing)

---

## Conclusion

**These bugs MUST be fixed before deploying stable indices to production.**

Both bugs cause data corruption that will be difficult to recover from:
- Bug #1 causes permanent ID collisions in architecture notes
- Bug #2 permanently loses user-defined sort orders

The fixes are straightforward (2 lines + refactor), but comprehensive test coverage is required to prevent regression.

**Status:** Ready for implementation (IDX-002)
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Production blocker
**Next Steps:** Fix bugs, add tests, verify with manual testing
