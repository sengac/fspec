| `@discovery-workflow` | Discovery workflow and bootstrapping processes |
| `@draft-driven` | Draft-driven development and feedback loops |
| `@execa` | Child process execution integration point |
| `@spec-alignment` | Specification Alignment |

**Rule**: Use automation tags to indicate integration points with automation systems and lifecycle hooks.

## Tag Combination Examples

### Example 1: Phase 1 Feature File Creation

```gherkin
@phase1 @cli @generator @feature-management @gherkin @cross-platform @critical @unit-test @integration-test
Feature: Create Feature File with Template
Feature: Create Feature File with Template
```

**Interpretation**:
- Phase 1 feature
- Belongs to CLI and generator components
- Part of feature management functionality
- Ensures Gherkin compliance
- Must work on all platforms
- Critical priority (core functionality)
- Requires both unit and integration tests

### Example 2: Phase 2 Tag Registry Validation

```gherkin
@phase2 @validator @tag-management @validation @error-handling @high @integration-test @hook
Feature: Validate Feature File Tags Against Registry
Feature: Create Feature File with Template
```

**Interpretation**:
- Phase 2 feature
- Belongs to validator component
- Part of tag management functionality
- Includes validation and error handling
- High priority
- Requires integration tests
- Called from lifecycle hooks

### Example 3: Phase 3 Advanced Querying

```gherkin
@phase3 @cli @querying @parser @ast @medium @unit-test @e2e-test
Feature: Advanced Scenario Search and Filtering
Feature: Create Feature File with Template
```

**Interpretation**:
- Phase 3 feature
- Belongs to CLI and querying components
- Uses parser and AST processing
- Medium priority
- Requires unit and end-to-end tests

## Usage Guidelines

### Required Tag Combinations

- One Phase Tag: @phase1, @phase2, or @phase3
- At least One Component Tag: @cli, @parser, @generator, @validator, etc.
- At least One Feature Group Tag: @feature-management, @tag-management, etc.

**Minimum Example**:

```gherkin
@phase1 @cli @feature-management
Feature: Minimal Valid Feature
```

### Recommended Tag Combinations

- Required tags (phase, component, feature group)
- Technical tags for key architectural concerns
- Platform tags if platform-specific
- Priority tag for implementation planning
- Testing tags for test strategy
- Automation integration tags if applicable

**Recommended Example**:

```gherkin
@phase1 @cli @parser @validation @gherkin @cucumber-parser @error-handling @cross-platform @critical @integration-test @hook
Feature: Gherkin Syntax Validation
```

### Tag Ordering Convention

- Phase tag
- Component tag(s)
- Feature group tag(s)
- Technical tags
- Platform tags
- Priority tag
- Status tag
- Testing tags
- Automation integration tags

**Example**:

```gherkin
@phase2 @cli @validator @tag-management @validation @mermaid @cross-platform @high @wip @integration-test @hook
Feature: FOUNDATION.md Mermaid Diagram Validation
```

## Adding New Tags

### Process

**Identify Need**: Determine if existing tags are insufficient

**Check Registry**: Verify tag doesn't already exist in this document

**Define Tag**: Create clear description and usage guidelines

**Update TAGS.md**: Add to appropriate category table

**Document Examples**: Show how tag should be used

**Use fspec**: Register tag using `fspec register-tag` command

**Apply**: Use tag in feature files

### Naming Conventions

- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for multi-word tags (@cross-platform, not @crossplatform)
- Be specific and descriptive (@cucumber-parser not @parser-integration)
- Avoid redundancy (@cli-commands → just @cli)
- Keep concise (prefer @wip over @work-in-progress)

### Anti-Patterns

❌ **DON'T**:
- Create overlapping tags (@validate and @validation → use @validation)
- Use vague tags (@important → use @critical, @high, etc.)
- Create single-use tags (@login-feature → use combination of existing tags)
- Mix concerns (@cli-validation → use @cli @validation)

✅ **DO**:
- Reuse existing tags through combinations
- Create specific technical tags (@gherkin, @mermaid)
- Document new tags thoroughly
- Use tags to enable filtering and reporting

## Common Tag Queries

**All Phase 1 features**:

```bash
fspec list-features --tag=@phase1
```

**Critical validation features**:

```bash
fspec list-features --tag=@validation --tag=@critical
```

**Features requiring integration tests**:

```bash
fspec list-features --tag=@integration-test
```

**Lifecycle hook integration points**:

```bash
fspec list-features --tag=@hook
```

**Cross-platform CLI features**:

```bash
fspec list-features --tag=@cli --tag=@cross-platform
```

**Update Command**: `fspec tag-stats`

---

## Validation

### Rules

- **Registry Compliance**: All tags in feature files MUST exist in this TAGS.md
- **Required Tags**: Every feature MUST have phase + component + feature group tags
- **No Orphans**: Tags in TAGS.md should be used in at least one feature file
- **Consistent Naming**: Follow tag naming conventions strictly

### Commands

**Validate all feature files**:

```bash
fspec validate-tags
```

**Check for orphaned tags**:

```bash
fspec tag-stats --show-orphans
```

**Validate specific feature**:

```bash
fspec validate login.feature
```
