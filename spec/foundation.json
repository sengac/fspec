      "title": "Requirements and implementation are disconnected across fragmented tools, causing lost context, broken traceability, and undisciplined AI agents",
      "description": "Product owners define business value in Jira. Business analysts capture requirements in sticky notes during Example Mapping sessions that get photographed and forgotten. Developers write Gherkin specs in .feature files disconnected from those requirements. QA engineers write tests disconnected from the specs. AI agents skip all of this and write code with zero traceability. The result: what gets built rarely matches what was discussed, tests don't validate the right things, and nobody can trace a line of code back to the business requirement that justified it. Every handoff loses context. Every tool works in isolation. Every AI agent operates without discipline or guardrails.",
