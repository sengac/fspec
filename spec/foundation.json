      "title": "AI agents lack professional software development infrastructure and discipline",
      "description": "AI agents operate without the foundational tools and processes that professional developers rely on. While it's possible to manually enforce acceptance criteria or capture requirements through collaborative discovery, there's nothing easy or automated to help AI agents do it correctly. AI agents confabulate without quality examples and don't ask clarifying questions when faced with uncertainty. TDD guardrails aren't automated. Checkpoint systems for safe experimentation are either missing or poorly implemented. Kanban boards for tracking workflow state require manual effort. Specification management systems with diagram viewers and documentation aren't integrated into AI workflows. Coverage tracking to link code back to business rules isn't automated. Without easy, automated infrastructure, AI agents code blindly, making teams spend time babysitting rather than building, unable to trust AI for production-grade development.",

    "overview": "Provide a complete, automated infrastructure that integrates directly into AI agent workflows. Offer easy-to-use tools for collaborative discovery (Example Mapping, Event Storming) that guide AI agents through proper requirements gathering. Automate ACDD workflow management with Kanban boards, work units, and dependency tracking. Build in automatic checkpoints for safe experimentation and instant rollback. Enforce TDD discipline with automated validation gates that prevent code-before-tests. Provide integrated specification management with visual diagram support. Automatically track full traceability from business rules through scenarios to tests to implementation. Transform the AI development experience from manual babysitting to automated, disciplined, production-ready software delivery.",
