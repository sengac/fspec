      "title": "AI Agents Lack Professional Development Discipline",
      "description": "AI coding agents operate without the structured workflow discipline that professional developers rely on. They skip critical discovery steps like Example Mapping, write code before tests, ignore acceptance criteria, work out of temporal order, and lack traceability from code back to business requirements. This forces developers into constant supervision mode - micromanaging the AI, catching mistakes, and manually enforcing workflow steps - instead of focusing on higher-level problem solving and architecture.",

    "overview": "fspec provides a complete workflow enforcement system that guides AI agents through professional ACDD (Acceptance Criteria Driven Development) practices. It enforces temporal ordering to prevent retroactive workflow walking, uses system reminders to catch anti-patterns, maintains end-to-end traceability from code to business rules, provides git-based checkpoints for safe experimentation, and integrates research tools for discovery-first development. The system transforms AI agents from undisciplined code generators into structured software engineers.",
