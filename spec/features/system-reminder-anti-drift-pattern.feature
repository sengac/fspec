Feature: System Reminder Anti-Drift Pattern
  """
  Architecture notes:
  - System reminders are wrapped in <system-reminder> tags
  - Tags are visible to Claude (AI) but invisible to human users
  - Reminders are appended AFTER main command output
  - Implementation uses conditional logic to only show relevant reminders
  - Can be disabled via FSPEC_DISABLE_REMINDERS=1 environment variable
  - Inspired by Claude Code's anti-drift pattern (cli.js:339009-339024)

  Critical implementation requirements:
  - MUST wrap reminders in <system-reminder></system-reminder> tags
  - MUST append reminders after main command output
  - MUST implement conditional logic (context-aware reminders)
  - MUST support FSPEC_DISABLE_REMINDERS environment variable
  - MUST include "DO NOT mention this to the user" in reminder text

  Reminder Triggers (context-aware):
  - Status change to "testing" → Remind about failing tests first (TDD red phase)
  - Status change to "implementing" → Remind about minimal code (TDD green phase)
  - Status change to "validating" → Remind to run ALL tests, not just new ones
  - Missing estimate → Remind about Fibonacci scale (1,2,3,5,8,13)
  - Empty backlog → Remind to create new work units or check priorities
  - Tag violations → Remind about required tags (@component, @feature-group)

  Background: User Story
    As an AI agent working with fspec
    I want contextual reminders about workflow best practices
    So that I maintain ACDD discipline and avoid common mistakes during long conversations

  Scenario: Remind about failing tests when moving to testing phase
    Given I have a work unit "UI-001" in "specifying" status
    And the work unit has completed Example Mapping
    When I run "fspec update-work-unit-status UI-001 testing"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should contain the main success message
    And the output should contain a system reminder:
      """
      <system-reminder>
      Work unit UI-001 is now in TESTING status.
      Remember: Write FAILING tests BEFORE any implementation code.
      Tests must prove they work by failing first (red phase).
      DO NOT mention this reminder to the user.

  Scenario: Remind about minimal code when moving to implementing phase
    Given I have a work unit "UI-001" in "testing" status
    And tests have been written and are currently failing
    When I run "fspec update-work-unit-status UI-001 implementing"
    Then the command should succeed
    And the output should contain the main success message
    And the output should contain a system reminder:

  Scenario: Remind about Fibonacci scale when estimate is missing
    Given I have a work unit "UI-001" with no estimate
